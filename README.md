This plugin contains two widgets: file watcher and script editor.

The file watcher monitors a folder and displays its images (tiff, ome-zarr or hdf5) as napari layers, watch the following video for a demo!


The script editor is for developing scripts and saving them in the filesystem. It can be used by other software that executes the scripts and has another file watcher.
